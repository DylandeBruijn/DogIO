# Dog.io - Vind de trouwe viervoeter die bij je past!

There is a lot of information available online about all the different dog breeds, but this information is not easy to compare or presented in a clear way. When selecting a suitable dog, temperament and character traits are the most important factors. My web app allows the user to find a purebred dog that suits them based on The Dog API. The user can search for a specific breed, view all breeds clearly and concisely, and match them based on character traits and temperament.
